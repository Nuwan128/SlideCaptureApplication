# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of the project:

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| 1.2.x    | :white_check_mark:  |
| 1.1.x    | :white_check_mark:  |
| 1.0.x    | :x:                |

If you are using any version below 1.1.x, we strongly recommend upgrading to a supported version for continued security updates and improvements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities in the project, please report them immediately. Here's how to report a vulnerability:

- **Email**: Please send an email to [nuwan.pradeep.dev@gmail.com](mailto:nuwan.pradeep.dev@gmail.com) with the details of the issue.
- **Content**: Include a description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact. The more detailed, the better.
  
### Response Time

We aim to respond to vulnerability reports within **48 hours** of submission. Updates on the issue will be provided regularly, usually every **5-7 days**, until we have a solution or a decision on the report.

### Handling the Report

Once a vulnerability is reported:
- We will investigate and confirm the issue.
- If the vulnerability is valid, we will work on a fix and issue an update, acknowledging the reporter if requested.
- If the issue is not considered a vulnerability, we will provide reasoning and close the report.

For urgent issues, we may issue a security patch release as quickly as possible.

Thank you for helping to keep our project secure!
